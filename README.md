# RL and MARL for Retail Price Optimisation

**Author**: Basil Pradipta  
**Dissertation Project** – MSc in Business Analytics

This repository contains the complete Jupyter notebook for my dissertation titled:

**“Machine Learning for Retail Market”**

The project explores how RL and MARL techniques can be applied to optimise retail pricing strategies using historical sales data, demand modeling with LSTM, price elasticity estimation, and reinforcement learning.
